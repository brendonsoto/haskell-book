1.
a) 8 + 7 * 9
b) (8 + 7) * 9
Parenthesis would change the results since multiplication has a higher precedence than addition.

2.
a) perimeter x y = (x * 2) + (y * 2)
b) perimeter x y = x * 2 + y * 2
The parenthesis don't matter since the parenthesis in a) group the higher precedence function.

3.
a) f x = x / 2 + 9
b) f x = x / (2 + 9)
The parenthesis do make a difference since addition is of lower precedence than division.
