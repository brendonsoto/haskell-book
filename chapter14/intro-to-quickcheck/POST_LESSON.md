# Post Intro-to-QuickCheck Thoughts

The biggest thing I think the article shared was the idea of thinking in properties.
This enables more general testing instead of testing specific examples.

Another thing was observing the random input used for testing to ensure a proper variation of contexts are provided to the function in test. I always saw QuickCheck by default as sufficient enough.

Thinking in properties will be a difficult thing for me to pick up on, but the value in it does seem high. I do hope to see some crossover between property-testing in Haskell and testing in JavaScript.
